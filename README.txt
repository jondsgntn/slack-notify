SLACK NOTIFY

This is an early stage of a ruby script used to read a list of websites, check the status of them, and return the results.

If a site returns a 40x or 50x error, a notification is sent to a specified Slack channel

If a site returns an error 5 times in a row, a text is sent out to a specified phone number
